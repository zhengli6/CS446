# ClashRoyale_prediction
A Machine learning model for mobile game Clash Royale match prediction (2016)

This project is written in Python

This project tests multiple machine learning algorithms to perform match prediction using 180,000 top player's game match records. Among all the tested algorithms, AdaBoost reach 63.7& accuracy and outperformed other alternatives. 

Implemented Algorithms:

Decision Tree

AdaBoost

SVM

Random Forest

Navie Bayes

Two-layer perceptron
